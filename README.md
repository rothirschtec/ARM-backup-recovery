# RTscripts
This script should help you with managing full images of your single board computer.
The goal is that you can backup your whole device including the bootloader, compressing it to the smallest possible version of an image and document it. You can then recover the backup to any sdCard or emmc storage you want.

### RTbackup.sh (BETA)
Use this script to backup the sdCard from your SBC like a bpi-m64.

### RTrecovery.sh (BETA)
Recover the backups made with RTbackup.sh

### Compatibility
